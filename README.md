This project is a solution to the Social Links Profile challenge on Frontend Mentor [https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). It aims to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing way to display social media profiles online.

### Functionality and Design Considerations

* **Responsive Design:** This component prioritizes responsiveness, ensuring it adapts seamlessly across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) for optimal user experience on any device. Media queries are utilized to adjust layout, font sizes, and spacing for different viewports.
* **Minimalist Aesthetic:** The design follows a clean and minimalist aesthetic, aligning with the provided style guide. Emphasis is placed on clarity and legibility, allowing users to focus on the essential information presented.
* **Social Link Features:** The component effectively displays essential profile information, including a user's name, avatar image, and various social media links. Each link is accompanied by a corresponding icon for easy visual recognition. 
* **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML is used throughout the code to enhance accessibility for users with assistive technologies. This ensures proper screen reader navigation and information structure.
* **Customization (Optional):** While the core functionality remains focused, the code includes opportunities for customization. Hover effects can be added to the social links to enhance user interaction and make the component more visually engaging. You can explore various methods for implementing hover effects using CSS techniques like pseudo-classes (:hover) or JavaScript libraries.
